# GeoMarvel-Exercise
Fall 2016 Internship Exercise - Florida Sinkholes

Jenna David
Utilized calcite bootstrap responsive framework to create a geo-centered interface
Created a webmap from the sinkhole feature layer

Altered the feature style to my preference and referenced the webmap in my code
Used ArcGIS API for Javascript 4.0 Reference to create map widgets (Search, Locate, HomeButton)
